# Contact Management System (CMS)‚òéÔ∏è

## OverviewüôÉ


The Contact Management System (CMS) is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their contacts efficiently. Whether for personal or professional use, this system allows users to create, delete, search, and update contacts with ease. The project is implemented in multiple programming languages, including Java and Python, to demonstrate different approaches to solving the same problem.

## Featuresüì≤

- **Create Contact**: Add new contacts with details such as name, email, and phone number.
- **Delete Contact**: Remove existing contacts by name.
- **Search Contact**: Find contacts by name.
- **Update Contact**: Modify existing contact details (Python version only).
- **List All Contacts**: View all contacts stored in the system (Python version only).

## Technologies Used üõû

- **Java**: The Java version of the CMS uses file I/O operations to store and manage contacts in a text file (`contacts.txt`).
- **Python**: The Python version uses JSON for storing contacts, providing a more structured and readable format (`contacts.json`).
